"# Sweeper-ai" 

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to streamline the process of data understanding and preprocessing using artificial intelligence. Users can upload CSV or Excel datasets, which are automatically cleaned, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data types. The app leverages advanced techniques such as vectorisation using HuggingFace sentence embeddings, FAISS indexing, and CURE clustering via KMedoids to better organize and analyse the data. Once processed, the dataset is passed to Googleâ€™s Gemini LLM through LangChain for deep analysis. The AI model provides detailed insights, including domain classification, data quality assessment, preprocessing suggestions, and even machine learning model recommendations. Users can download a cleaned version of their dataset as well as a comprehensive analysis report. With an intuitive interface and robust backend, this tool is ideal for data scientists, analysts, and developers seeking a quick and intelligent overview of raw data. It emphasises security by using environment variables for API keys and restricts upload sizes to ensure safe operations. The combination of automation, clustering, LLM-based insight generation, and interactive output makes this application a powerful assistant for early-stage data exploration.
